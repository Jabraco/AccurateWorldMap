- use normal polygon or controls to make polygons anchored to the map

- extract zone polygons

- start working on the data structure for zone info

- iterate though that zone structure, do the texture control trick to get the dimensions and then store the normalised height/width in the data structure


- add a way to convert between vanilla mouseover behaviour and your custom one


- put names of zones in the zone data, "Bleackrock Isle"

- split zone data between worldspace maps (1 and 0)

- make a fuction that removes punctuation from the name of the zone and then appends it to the blob filename uri

- send current coordinates of mouse to function

- if mouse click 



Mini zone list:

- Tempest Island
- Stirk
- Icereach
- Balfiera
- Wasten Coraldale
- Eyevea
- Topal Isle
- Firemoth Island
- Halls of Colossus
- Blackwood Borderlands
- Fort Grief isle (in middle of niben basin)
- Jerral Mountains Logging Track

(remove sheogorad from vvardenfell zone)


- Rename Northern Elsweyr to Anequinna
- Rename Southern Elsweyr to Quin-Rawl
- Rename Summerset to Summerset Isle

- Remove dragonhold from the map when you've done the quest

Breaux needs to give me:

- Norg-Tzel blob
- Greyhome blob

- Remastered, vanilla-style map

- Lore friendly overhaul of the map in line with previous games

- Dungeon and wayshrines have been moved to compensate

- Dungeons in their lore friendly places




"Fans have been asking ZOS for years to fix the ESO World Map, and they still haven't done it. So, we thought we'd fix it ourselves."

- add clickable area to arcane university battleground



add to readme:

the addons Destinations and Map Pins will add the old locations for certain wayshrines/dungeons to the map. Untick "unknown poi"'s to fix this


Note: after installing, some dungeon, wayshrines will be moved to a more lore friendly location, and thus will NOT match the in-game locations. This is intentional, and will not be changed.

the local zone map locations for dungeons remain as-is.

"The player location is wrong"

yes, this is because ZOS's zones are in the wrong position, and it is something we can't fix. ZOS themselves have run up to this issue with northern elsweyr, when you go up to the reapers march entrance, it puts you in cyrodiil


even if you don't care about the correctness of the map, this addon still offers something for you! it helps keep the worldmap clear of icon spam by moving some dungeons to their physical locations instead of where their entrances are
