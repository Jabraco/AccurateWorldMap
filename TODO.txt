- add a way to convert between vanilla mouseover behaviour and your custom one


- set up GetMapMouseoverInfo to be like getFastTravelNode info, overwrite the function and return vanilla/modded data depending on circumstances

todo: also find a way to call when on map open

- merge wayshrinedata and zoneblob data into one big structure called mapData

- add an event on map change to iterate through this list

- check if the current map id is in mapData, if it is, go inside

- does wayshrineData exist for this map? if yes, iterate through that

- does zoneData exist for this map? if yes, iterate through that

- blob data has an Exclusive attribute which defines whether the custom blobs defined here should prevent the vanilla ones from working, or 
is additive

if mapData[mapID].zoneData != nil then...




- use normal polygon or controls to make polygons anchored to the map

- extract zone polygons





- put names of zones in the zone data, "Bleakrock Isle"

- split zone data between worldspace maps (1 and 0)

- send current coordinates of mouse to function

- if mouse click , check if can click, if so, change map to that zone



Mini zone list:

- Tempest Island
- Stirk
- Icereach
- Balfiera
- Wasten Coraldale
- Eyevea
- Topal Isle
- Firemoth Island
- Halls of Colossus
- Blackwood Borderlands
- Fort Grief isle (in middle of niben basin)
- Jerral Mountains Logging Track
- Arcane University (in cyrodiil)

(remove sheogorad from vvardenfell zone)

- Rename Northern Elsweyr to Anequinna
- Rename Southern Elsweyr to Quin-Rawl
- Rename Summerset to Summerset Isle

- Remove dragonhold from the map when you've done the quest

Breaux needs to give me:

- Norg-Tzel blob
- Greyhome blob

- Remastered, vanilla-style map

- Lore friendly overhaul of the map in line with previous games

- Dungeon and wayshrines have been moved to compensate

- Dungeons in their lore friendly places




is it safe to put this onAddonLoaded btw?
parsing through big list of textures when game loads/reloadui starts (i think) will take a while
Baertram (Baertram)
hm I would not always do that, but only if there is the need to do that
like save to SavedVariables the GetAPIVersion() when it was last done and then set a flag "it was done" and check if this is true or false. If false: do the run once and update the apiversion last checked and the done flag



"Fans have been asking ZOS for years to fix the ESO World Map, and they still haven't done it. So, we thought we'd fix it ourselves."

- add clickable area to arcane university battleground



add to readme:

the addons Destinations and Map Pins will add the old locations for certain wayshrines/dungeons to the map. Untick "unknown poi"'s to fix this


Note: after installing, some dungeon, wayshrines will be moved to a more lore friendly location, and thus will NOT match the in-game locations. This is intentional, and will not be changed.

the local zone map locations for dungeons remain as-is.

"The player location is wrong"

yes, this is because ZOS's zones are in the wrong position, and it is something we can't fix. ZOS themselves have run up to this issue with northern elsweyr, when you go up to the reapers march entrance, it puts you in cyrodiil


even if you don't care about the correctness of the map, this addon still offers something for you! it helps keep the worldmap clear of icon spam by moving some dungeons to their physical locations instead of where their entrances are
