Breaux needs to give me:

- Norg-Tzel blob
- Greyhome blob

- Remastered, vanilla-style map

- Lore friendly overhaul of the map in line with previous games

- Dungeon and wayshrines have been moved to compensate

- Dungeons in their lore friendly places




is it safe to put this onAddonLoaded btw?
parsing through big list of textures when game loads/reloadui starts (i think) will take a while
Baertram (Baertram)
hm I would not always do that, but only if there is the need to do that
like save to SavedVariables the GetAPIVersion() when it was last done and then set a flag "it was done" and check if this is true or false. If false: do the run once and update the apiversion last checked and the done flag



"Fans have been asking ZOS for years to fix the ESO World Map, and they still haven't done it. So, we thought we'd fix it ourselves."

- add clickable area to arcane university battleground



add to readme:

the addons Destinations and Map Pins will add the old locations for certain wayshrines/dungeons to the map. Untick "unknown poi"'s to fix this


Note: after installing, some dungeon, wayshrines will be moved to a more lore friendly location, and thus will NOT match the in-game locations. This is intentional, and will not be changed.

the local zone map locations for dungeons remain as-is.

"The player location is wrong"

yes, this is because ZOS's zones are in the wrong position, and it is something we can't fix. ZOS themselves have run up to this issue with northern elsweyr, when you go up to the reapers march entrance, it puts you in cyrodiil


even if you don't care about the correctness of the map, this addon still offers something for you! it helps keep the worldmap clear of icon spam by moving some dungeons to their physical locations instead of where their entrances are
