# AccurateWorldMap

AccurateWorldMap is an addon for the Elder Scrolls Online (ESO), which replaces the in-game world map with one that is higher quality, more accurate, and lore friendly.

## Features

- Remastered, vanilla-style map

- Lore friendly overhaul of the map in line with previous games

- Dungeon and wayshrines have been moved to compensate

- Dungeons in their lore friendly places

## Notes

After installing, some dungeons, zones and wayshrines will be moved to lore friendly locations, and thus will not match the in-game locations. This is intentional, and will not be changed.

The local zone map locations for dungeons remain as-is.

## Compatibility

The addons Destinations and MapPins are not compatible with this addon, as they add pins to vanilla locations. This addon moves some zones and pins to be more accurate with the real shape of Tamriel.

MapPins' incompatibility cannot be mitigated, but Destinations can be fixed by unticking "Unknown POI's" in the in-game map filters menu.

## Issues

The player location on the map will be incorrect in certain zones, this is because this addon moves certain zones on the world map to where they are in the lore, to be more accurate. We hope to fix this in a future version.
