Accurate World Map is an addon for the Elder Scrolls Online (ESO), that replaces the in-game world map with a higher quality, and more lore accurate one.

## Features

- Remastered, vanilla-style map
- Lore friendly overhaul of the map in line with previous games
- Zones and Dungeons in their lore accurate places
- Lore accurate renames of zones and places
- Customise how wayshrines appear on the world map

## Notes

After installing, zones, dungeons, and wayshrines will be moved to their more lore accurate locations, and thus will not match the in-game locations. This is intentional, and will not be changed.

## Compatibility

Any addon that adds pins to vanilla locations on the world map are not compatible with this addon, as Accurate World Map moves zones and pins from their vanilla locations to be more accurate with the real shape of Tamriel.

The following addons have been tested to be not compatible with Accurate World Map:

- GuildShrines
- Destinations
- MapPins

GuildShrines is unneeded when using this addon, as Accurate World Map replicates its functionality. If you choose to keep GuildShrines enabled, then those wayshrines will be misaligned on the map.

Destinations and MapPins add pins to vanilla locations, so they are not compatible. MapPins' incompatibility cannot be mitigated, but Destinations can be fixed by unticking "Unknown POI's" in the in-game map filters menu.

## Works Great With

This addon works great with the following addons:

- True Exploration
- Votan's Improved Locations
- DarkUI
