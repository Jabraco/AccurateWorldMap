# Accurate World Map

Accurate World Map is an addon for the Elder Scrolls Online (ESO), that replaces the in-game world map with a higher quality, and more lore accurate one.

## Features

- Remastered, vanilla-style map

- Lore friendly overhaul of the map in line with previous games

- Dungeons in their lore friendly places

## Notes

After installing, zones, dungeons, and wayshrines will be moved to their more lore accurate locations, and thus will not match the in-game locations. This is intentional, and will not be changed.

## Compatibility

test

The following addons are not compatible with AccurateWorldMap:

- Destinations
- MapPins
- GuildShrines

Destinations and MapPins add pins to vanilla locations, thus are not compatible with this addon. This addon moves zones and pins from their vanilla locations to be more accurate with the real shape of Tamriel.

MapPins' incompatibility cannot be mitigated, but Destinations can be fixed by unticking "Unknown POI's" in the in-game map filters menu.

GuildShrines is unneeded when using this addon, as AccurateWorldMap replicates its functionality. If you choose to keep GuildShrines enabled, then those wayshrines will be misaligned on the map.

## Issues

The player location on the map will be incorrect in certain zones, this is because this addon moves certain zones on the world map to where they are in the lore, to be more accurate. We hope to fix this in a future version.
